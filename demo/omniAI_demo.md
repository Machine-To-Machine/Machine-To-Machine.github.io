# OmniAI Demo

**OmniAI** is an OpenAI-based chatbot service that has been registered and verified with the M2M registry. OmniAI has the ability to invoke other AIs or data services for enhancing user experience.

**Important Notice:** As of December 2024, our beta repositories and corresponding demos are no longer functioning. This is due to TBD discontinuing operations and shutting down their gateway node on the DHT network.
