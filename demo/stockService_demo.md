# Stock Service Demo

**Stock Service** is a data provider service for AIs that has been registered and verified with the M2M registry.

**Important Notice:** As of December 2024, our beta repositories and corresponding demos are no longer functioning. This is due to TBD discontinuing operations and shutting down their gateway node on the DHT network.
